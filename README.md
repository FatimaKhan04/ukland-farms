# UKlandAndFarms
In this data mining project, I undertook the task of collecting valuable data from the UKLandandFarms website, which specializes in providing information about land and farms available for sale in the United Kingdom.
The goal was to gather comprehensive data on various properties listed on the website and store it in a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format for further analysis
